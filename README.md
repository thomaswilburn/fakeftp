I have a lot of sites stored in WinSCP, and I've forgotten the password for most of them. 
This effectively means I only have one machine that can actually get to them. This script 
creates a fake FTP server, just competent enough to fool the login process of FTP software, 
and then logs out the credentials for recovery.
